# AI-project-

## Overview
This project implements and modifies the FSRO (Frog Snake Prey Predation) Optimization Algorithm. The FSRO algorithm is inspired by the natural predation behaviors of frogs and snakes, and it is used to solve optimization problems effectively.

## Features
- Implementation of the FSRO algorithm.
- Modifications to improve the algorithm's performance.
- Includes a Jupyter Notebook (`improved.ipynb`) for interactive exploration and testing.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (see below)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/AI-project-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook improved.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the FSRO algorithm and explore its modifications.
